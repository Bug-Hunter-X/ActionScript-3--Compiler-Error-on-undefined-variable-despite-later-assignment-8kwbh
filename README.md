This repository demonstrates an uncommon ActionScript 3 compiler error related to accessing undefined variables.  The error occurs even when the variable is assigned a value later in the function. This differs from dynamic languages where the error might only surface at runtime. The solution involves ensuring variables are declared and initialized before use or using conditional checks to avoid accessing them prematurely.  This is a crucial aspect of ActionScript development that warrants careful attention to avoid unexpected compiler errors.
